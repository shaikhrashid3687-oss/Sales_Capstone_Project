## Sales Analytics Capstone Project
## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end Sales Analytics capstone project created as part of my Data Analytics course.
The project focuses on analyzing sales performance, profit, and discount impact using SQL, Python, and Power BI.

## Business Problem

The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to understand revenue and profit patterns.
The analysis helps identify high-performing products, profitable regions, and areas where discounts negatively impact profit.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains transactional sales data including order details, sales amount, profit, discount, product categories, and regional information.
This data represents a typical retail sales scenario.

##  Key Insights
- Some regions generate high sales but low profit due to heavy discounting.
- Certain product categories contribute more to profit despite lower sales volume.
- Monthly sales trends show seasonal patterns that impact overall revenue.
- Higher discounts are associated with reduced profit margins.


## Business Recommendations
- Limit high discounts on low-margin products to improve profitability.
- Focus marketing and inventory efforts on high-profit categories.
- Use seasonal sales trends to plan promotions and inventory in advance.
- Monitor regional performance to optimize pricing and discount strategies.

  ## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in the complete data analytics workflow.
- Improved skills in SQL querying, Python EDA, and Power BI visualization.
- Learned how to document and present data insights effectively using GitHub.
